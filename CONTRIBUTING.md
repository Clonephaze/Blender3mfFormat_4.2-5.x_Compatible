# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **Blender 3MF Format**.

This addon provides comprehensive **3MF Core Spec v1.4.0** import/export for Blender 5.0+ (minimum Blender 4.2+), with multi-material paint support for Orca Slicer, BambuStudio, PrusaSlicer, and SuperSlicer. It's a complete modernization of the original add-on (created by Ghostkeeper) with a focus on **correctness, spec compliance, and predictable import/export behavior**.

## Where development happens

Development and issue tracking happens in this repository.

Historical upstream (no longer maintained):

- https://github.com/Ghostkeeper/Blender3mfFormat

## What to contribute

Good contributions include:

- Fixes for Blender 4.2+ / 5.0+ API changes / regressions
- 3MF import/export correctness fixes (especially edge cases)
- Test coverage (unit or integration)
- Documentation improvements (README, API docs, copilot instructions)
- MMU Paint Suite improvements (paint panel, texture handling)
- Small quality-of-life improvements that don't change file semantics
- Triangle Sets / Materials Extension support improvements

Non-goals (usually):

- "Opinionated" transformations of scene data on import/export
- Silent data loss or auto-fixing invalid files without clearly reporting it
- Large refactors without a clear benefit or test coverage
- Breaking changes to the public API (`api.py`) without strong justification

## Bug reports

Before opening a new issue, please search existing issues first.

When reporting a bug, include:

1. **Blender version** (e.g. 4.2.x LTS / 5.0.x - primary dev version is 5.0)
2. **OS** (Windows/macOS/Linux) and relevant hardware notes
3. **Steps to reproduce** (a minimal, reliable recipe)
4. **Expected vs actual behavior**
5. **Logs / traceback** (copy/paste from the system console, accessible via Window → Toggle System Console)
6. If relevant, a **minimal .3mf sample file**
7. For paint/segmentation issues: screenshots of the texture or face colors

If your file contains sensitive data, don't post it publicly. Instead, try to reproduce the issue with a sanitized/minimal file.

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome, but please keep the scope aligned with the project:

- The add-on's purpose is to **load and save 3MF files**.
- Changes that modify geometry/materials beyond what the format requires should be kept minimal.

When requesting a feature, describe:

- The user problem being solved
- Why it belongs in the add-on (vs being handled elsewhere)
- Any references to the 3MF spec or examples from other tools

## Pull requests

Pull requests are welcome.

### Basic workflow

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests (see below)
5. Open a PR with a clear description and screenshots/files when relevant

### Testing requirements

This project has **unit tests** and **integration tests**. All tests run in **real Blender headless mode** — no mocking. They require Blender's Python interpreter.

#### Run all tests (recommended before submitting PR)

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
python tests/run_all_tests.py
```

This spawns separate Blender processes for unit and integration tests, reporting pass/fail for both suites.

#### Unit tests only

Tests for individual functions (colors, segmentation codec, XML parsing, units, etc.) without creating Blender objects:

```powershell
blender --background --factory-startup --python-exit-code 1 -noaudio -q --python tests/run_unit_tests.py
```

Located in `tests/unit/`

#### Integration tests only

End-to-end tests that create real Blender objects, import/export `.3mf` files, and validate materials/geometry:

```powershell
blender --background --factory-startup --python-exit-code 1 -noaudio -q --python tests/run_tests.py
```

Located in `tests/integration/`

Test resources (sample files) are in `tests/resources/` and `tests/resources/3mf_consortium/`

**Note:** All tests require Blender's Python — don't use system Python or virtualenvs. You need Blender installed and available on your PATH.

### Code style and architecture

- Follow [Blender's Python style guide](https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Style_Guide/Python)
- PEP-8 compatible (`<pep8 compliant>` in headers)
- Keep changes focused and readable
- Prefer adding tests for bug fixes and behavior changes

**Architecture notes:**

- **Context dataclasses** — `ImportContext` / `ExportContext` replace mutable operator state. All helpers take `ctx` as first arg.
- **NO `logging` module** — use `common.logging` (`debug()`, `warn()`, `error()`) exclusively. Python's `logging` does nothing in Blender.
- **NO `print()` calls** — use `debug()` for dev output, `warn()`/`error()` for real issues.
- **Cache Blender strings** before XML ops — Python may GC the C string behind `blender_object.name`
- **Blender properties can't start with `_`** — use `3mf_` prefix for custom properties
- **Sub-package imports** — use `from ..common import ...` for common utilities
- See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for full architecture documentation

### Commit messages

Write meaningful commit messages. Avoid generic messages like “Update file” or “Fix stuff”.

Good examples:

- `Fix material slot indexing when exporting empty slots`
- `Update import operator for Blender 4.2 depsgraph API`

### Changelog

Please don't update `CHANGELOG.md` unless you're asked to. Maintainers will handle release notes.

## Reviewing PRs is also contributing

If you're not ready to code, you can still help by:

- Trying the add-on on your Blender version and reporting results
- Testing PR branches
- Improving docs
- Sharing minimal repro files for tricky import/export bugs
