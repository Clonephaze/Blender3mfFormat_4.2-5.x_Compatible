2.0.0 — Architecture Restructure & Public API
====

This is a major restructure of the entire codebase. The monolithic `import_3mf.py` (3055 lines, 56 methods) and `export_3mf.py` have been broken into clean, focused sub-packages. A new public API enables programmatic 3MF workflows without `bpy.ops`. All import/export functionality is unchanged — this is a code organization and robustness release.

> **Breaking:** Scripts that imported internal symbols directly from the old module layout will need updating. The `bpy.ops.import_mesh.threemf()` and `bpy.ops.export_mesh.threemf()` operators are unchanged.

Architecture
----
* **`import_3mf/` package** — Operator, context, archive, geometry, builder, scene, slicer detection, and materials sub-package
* **`export_3mf/` package** — Operator, context, archive, geometry, standard/orca/prusa exporters, components, thumbnail, segmentation, and materials sub-package
* **`common/` package** — Shared types, constants, colors, logging, XML utilities, units, segmentation codec, extensions, metadata, annotations
* **Context dataclasses** — `ImportContext` / `ExportContext` replace mutable operator state. Every helper takes `ctx` as its first argument.
* **Export dispatch** — `StandardExporter`, `OrcaExporter`, `PrusaExporter` classes replace monolithic if/else chains

Public API (`api.py`)
----
* **`import_3mf()`** — Headless import with all operator options as keyword arguments
* **`export_3mf()`** — Headless export with explicit object lists, format selection, callbacks
* **`inspect_3mf()`** — Read-only archive inspection without creating Blender objects (returns object counts, materials, textures, metadata, extensions, vendor format)
* **`batch_import()` / `batch_export()`** — Multi-file operations with per-file error isolation
* **Callbacks** — `on_progress`, `on_warning`, `on_object_created` for monitoring and integration
* **Building blocks** — Re-exports `colors`, `types`, `segmentation`, `units`, `extensions`, `xml_tools`, `metadata`, `components` sub-namespaces
* See **[API.md](API.md)** for full documentation and examples

Bug Fixes
----
* **Large colorgroup blocking** — 3MF files with 50,000+ colors in a single colorgroup (e.g. 3D scans with per-vertex coloring) no longer hang Blender. Groups exceeding 1,000 entries are skipped with a user-facing warning.
* **Menu duplicate fix** — Reinstalling the addon via drag-and-drop no longer causes duplicate Import/Export menu entries or `list.remove(x): x not in list` errors. Menu cleanup now matches by function identity rather than object reference.
* **Multiproperties per-vertex UV fix** — Multiproperties with multiple texture2dgroups now correctly resolve per-vertex UV coordinates from `p1`/`p2`/`p3` indices independently, instead of assigning the same UV to all three vertices.
* **PBR texture UV round-trip** — PBR textured materials (roughness, metallic, etc.) now export with proper `texture2dgroup` / `tex2coord` UV coordinate data alongside `pbmetallictexturedisplayproperties`. Previously, PBR materials were excluded from texture2dgroup creation, losing UV data on export.
* **Import texture coordinate source** — Textured materials imported from `texture2dgroup` data now use UV coordinates (not Generated), since a UV layer is guaranteed from the `tex2coord` import. PBR textures on meshes without UV data still fall back to Generated projection.
* **PBR base color deduplication** — When both `setup_textured_material` and `apply_pbr_textures_to_material` run on the same material, the base color texture is no longer wired twice. The PBR function detects and skips already-connected Base Color inputs.
* **Texture archive deduplication** — Texture images already written to the archive by the PBR pass are detected and reused instead of being written a second time.
* **Paint import crash fix** — Fixed `TypeError: render_segmentation_to_texture() got an unexpected keyword argument 'bpy'` caused by a leftover `bpy=bpy` kwarg from the restructure (parameter is named `bpy_module`).

Technical
----
* All custom logging uses `common/logging.py` (`debug`, `warn`, `error`, `safe_report`) — no Python `logging` module
* All tests run in real Blender headless mode (no mocking of Blender APIs)
* Test suite: 150 unit tests + 128 integration tests, all passing
* Build: `ThreeMF_io-2.0.0.zip` via `blender --command extension build`

---

1.4.0 — MMU Paint Import/Export Support w/ 3MF Paint panel

* **Paint import dialog:** Instructions for finding MMU Paint Suite panel after import, and a button to switch automatically. 

Bug Fixes
----
* **Fixed critical color space mismatch:** 3MF colors are sRGB, Blender materials are linear — now properly converting between them on import, export, and painting
* **Improved filament operations:** Filament removal and reassignment now provide feedback on pixel counts
* **Fixed PBR and Normal material import issues:** Materials with PBR textures now import correctly without creating duplicate materials or losing texture relationships

Technical
----
* Added sRGB ↔ linear color space conversion utilities (`srgb_to_linear()`, `linear_to_srgb()`, `hex_to_linear_rgb()`, `linear_rgb_to_hex()`)
* Applied conversions throughout: import materials (sRGB → linear), export materials (linear → sRGB), paint panel (all color operations)

Code Organization
----
* **Import/Export Module Refactoring:** Split large monolithic files into extension-centric packages for better maintainability and easier future additions:
  - `export_materials/` package: base.py, textures.py, pbr.py, passthrough.py
  - `import_materials/` package: base.py, textures.py, pbr.py, passthrough.py
  - Standalone `export_trianglesets.py` and `import_trianglesets.py` modules
* Backward-compatible re-exports preserve existing API

1.1.3 — Unicode String Caching & Garbage Collection Protection
====
This release adds comprehensive defensive string caching throughout the add-on to protect Unicode characters from Python's garbage collector. This ensures users with non-ASCII characters (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, emoji, etc.) in object names, material names, file paths, and metadata will not experience corruption or data loss.

Features
----
* **Defensive String Caching:**
  - Cache all object names, material names, metadata (names, values, datatypes), and file names before XML or export operations to protect Unicode from garbage collection
  - Explicit `str()` conversion ensures strings persist while Blender's UI or export processes are active

* **Unicode Support Improvements:**
  - Full support for all non-standard Unicode characters in object names, material names, metadata, and file path

Testing
----
* **New comprehensive Unicode test suite** (`tests/test_unicode.py`):
  - 20+ tests covering Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, emoji, and mixed Unicode
  - Tests for object names, material names, metadata, and roundtrip preservation
  - Tests for edge cases: RTL text, combining characters, surrogate pairs, very long names
* **Added to mock test suite** (`test/metadata.py`, `test/export_3mf.py`):
  - 6 new tests for Unicode metadata compatibility and conflict detection
  - 2 new tests for Unicode object and material name caching
* All existing tests continue to pass, ensuring backward compatibility

1.1.1 - 1.1.2 — Unit Handling, Precision & Preferences
====
This release refines the modernized addon with improved unit handling, higher-fidelity coordinate export, better object naming, and configurable defaults via addon preferences.

Features
----
* **Unit & Scale Handling:**
  - Fix export scaling for combinations of scene scale and units (e.g. scale_length = 0.001 with millimeter units), so 3MF files now match Blender dimensions across common unit setups.
  - Improve import scaling by correctly interpreting the 3MF model `unit` attribute and converting to Blender scene units.
* **Object Naming & Visibility:**
  - Export the Blender object name into the 3MF model, improving round‑trip fidelity and interoperability with slicers.
  - Import object names from 3MF back into Blender objects when available.
  - Add an `Export hidden objects` option to the export operator so viewport‑hidden objects can be explicitly included or excluded.
  - **User notification** when hidden objects are skipped during export, with a count and hint to enable the option.
* **Coordinate Precision & Formatting:**
  - Increase default coordinate precision to 9 decimal places to preserve full 32‑bit float resolution and reduce the risk of non‑manifold issues from rounding.
  - Standardize transformation matrix formatting to 9 decimal places for consistent, high‑precision output.

Addon Preferences
----
* Add `ThreeMFPreferences` (Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → 3MF) to configure default behavior:
  - **Default Coordinate Precision** for exports.
  - **Export Hidden Objects by Default** toggle.
  - **Apply Modifiers by Default** toggle.
  - **Default Global Scale** shared by import and export operators.
* Enhanced preferences UI with grouped settings, icons, and helpful tooltips.
* Export/import operators read these preferences on `invoke`, so dialogs open with user‑chosen defaults while still allowing per‑export overrides.

Testing & Maintenance
----
* Extend unit tests to cover:
  - New unit/scene scale behavior for export and import.
  - Hidden‑object export behavior and notification.
  - High‑precision transformation formatting.
  - Preferences loading in `invoke()` methods.
* Update tests and documentation to reflect the new defaults and options.
