1.2.5 — Quality of Life Improvements
====
Export validation, smart material reuse, and flexible import placement options.

Features
----
* **Non-Manifold Detection:** Pre-export geometry validation warns about problematic meshes that may cause slicer issues
* **Material Reuse:** Import now matches and reuses existing Blender materials by name and color, preventing duplication on re-import
* **Selection Validation:** "Selection Only" export validates mesh objects are selected before proceeding
* **Import Placement Options:** Control object placement (World Origin / 3D Cursor / Keep Original) and origin calculation on import

Improvements
----
* All new features have preference defaults and integrate seamlessly into existing UI
* Import origin-to-geometry calculated before transformation for correct positioning

---

1.2.4 — PrusaSlicer MMU Export & Color Preservation
====
Full round-trip color support for PrusaSlicer MMU workflows and improved user feedback.

Features
----
* **PrusaSlicer MMU Export:** Face colors exported with `slic3rpe:mmu_segmentation` attributes and color metadata for perfect round-trips
* **Progress Messages:** Status feedback during import/export operations
* **Color Fidelity:** Fixed color space handling for accurate material preservation across all formats

Improvements
----
* Refactored export code following DRY principles (extracted helper methods, merged duplicate code)

---

1.2.3 — 3MF Core Specification v1.4.0 Compliance
====
Updated to target the latest 3MF Core Specification v1.4.0 (published February 6, 2025).

Features

Changes
----
* Updated `SPEC_VERSION` constant from "1.3.0" to "1.4.0"
* Added `TRIANGLE_SETS_NAMESPACE` constant for grouping triangles

---

1.2.2 — PrusaSlicer Compatibility & Thumbnails
====
This extremely small patch simply adds a tag to the blender manifest.toml

---

1.2.1 — PrusaSlicer Compatibility & Thumbnails
====

* **Thumbnails:** Automatic viewport snapshot embedded in exported 3MF files (256×256 PNG)
* **Cross-Slicer Compatibility:** Color zones now work with both PrusaSlicer and Orca Slicer formats

Bug Fixes
----
* Fixed PrusaSlicer imports not showing color zones/materials

  - Multi-file export structure with individual object models in `3D/Objects/`
  - `p:path` and `p:UUID` component references for external model files
  - Proper OPC relationship files (`3D/_rels/3dmodel.model.rels`)
  - Import support for external model file references

* **Orca Slicer / BambuStudio Compatibility:**
  - **Export:** New "Orca Slicer Color Zones" option exports face colors as filament zones
  - **Export:** Per-triangle `paint_color` attributes for precise filament assignment
  - **Export:** Generates `Metadata/project_settings.config` with filament colors
  - **Import:** Reads `paint_color` attributes and creates corresponding Blender materials
  - **Import:** Extracts actual filament colors from `project_settings.config`
  - **Round-trip:** Full color preservation between Blender and Orca Slicer

* **3MF Core Specification v1.3.0 Compliance:**
  - Added `SPEC_VERSION` constant tracking specification version
  - Support for `recommendedextensions` attribute (v1.3.0 addition)
  - OPC Core Properties with Dublin Core metadata

Technical Improvements
----
* **Extension Prefix Resolution:**
  - Fixed `requiredextensions="p"` validation (was comparing prefix to namespace URI)
  - `resolve_extension_prefixes()` maps XML prefixes to full namespace URIs
  - Known prefix mappings for Production, Materials, and Slic3r extensions

* **Color Indexing:**
  - 1-based filament indexing matching Orca Slicer's `paint_color` encoding
  - Proper mapping between paint codes ("4", "8", "0C", etc.) and filament array indices
  - Case-insensitive paint code parsing

* **Code Organization:**
  - Separated Orca export into dedicated methods (`execute_orca_export`, `write_orca_object_model`, etc.)
  - Standard export preserved in `execute_standard_export`
  - Clean separation of vendor-specific and standard 3MF handling

Documentation
----
* Updated README with comprehensive Extensions section
* Added Orca Slicer compatibility documentation
* Round-trip workflow instructions

1.1.3 — Unicode String Caching & Garbage Collection Protection
====
This release adds comprehensive defensive string caching throughout the add-on to protect Unicode characters from Python's garbage collector. This ensures users with non-ASCII characters (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, emoji, etc.) in object names, material names, file paths, and metadata will not experience corruption or data loss.

Features
----
* **Defensive String Caching:**
  - Cache all object names, material names, metadata (names, values, datatypes), and file names before XML or export operations to protect Unicode from garbage collection
  - Explicit `str()` conversion ensures strings persist while Blender's UI or export processes are active

* **Unicode Support Improvements:**
  - Full support for all non-standard Unicode characters in object names, material names, metadata, and file path

Testing
----
* **New comprehensive Unicode test suite** (`tests/test_unicode.py`):
  - 20+ tests covering Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, emoji, and mixed Unicode
  - Tests for object names, material names, metadata, and roundtrip preservation
  - Tests for edge cases: RTL text, combining characters, surrogate pairs, very long names
* **Added to mock test suite** (`test/metadata.py`, `test/export_3mf.py`):
  - 6 new tests for Unicode metadata compatibility and conflict detection
  - 2 new tests for Unicode object and material name caching
* All existing tests continue to pass, ensuring backward compatibility

1.1.1 - 1.1.2 — Unit Handling, Precision & Preferences
====
This release refines the modernized addon with improved unit handling, higher-fidelity coordinate export, better object naming, and configurable defaults via addon preferences.

Features
----
* **Unit & Scale Handling:**
  - Fix export scaling for combinations of scene scale and units (e.g. scale_length = 0.001 with millimeter units), so 3MF files now match Blender dimensions across common unit setups.
  - Improve import scaling by correctly interpreting the 3MF model `unit` attribute and converting to Blender scene units.
* **Object Naming & Visibility:**
  - Export the Blender object name into the 3MF model, improving round‑trip fidelity and interoperability with slicers.
  - Import object names from 3MF back into Blender objects when available.
  - Add an `Export hidden objects` option to the export operator so viewport‑hidden objects can be explicitly included or excluded.
  - **User notification** when hidden objects are skipped during export, with a count and hint to enable the option.
* **Coordinate Precision & Formatting:**
  - Increase default coordinate precision to 9 decimal places to preserve full 32‑bit float resolution and reduce the risk of non‑manifold issues from rounding.
  - Standardize transformation matrix formatting to 9 decimal places for consistent, high‑precision output.

Addon Preferences
----
* Add `ThreeMFPreferences` (Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → 3MF) to configure default behavior:
  - **Default Coordinate Precision** for exports.
  - **Export Hidden Objects by Default** toggle.
  - **Apply Modifiers by Default** toggle.
  - **Default Global Scale** shared by import and export operators.
* Enhanced preferences UI with grouped settings, icons, and helpful tooltips.
* Export/import operators read these preferences on `invoke`, so dialogs open with user‑chosen defaults while still allowing per‑export overrides.

Testing & Maintenance
----
* Extend unit tests to cover:
  - New unit/scene scale behavior for export and import.
  - Hidden‑object export behavior and notification.
  - High‑precision transformation formatting.
  - Preferences loading in `invoke()` methods.
* Update tests and documentation to reflect the new defaults and options.
